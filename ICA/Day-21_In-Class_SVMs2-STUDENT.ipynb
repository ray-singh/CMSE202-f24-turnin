    "## 4.4 Optimizing hyper-parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parameters we might try to optimize to get better results:\n",
    "- the C parameter of SVM. We discussed this in the previous in-class assignment\n",
    "- the $\\gamma$ parameter of rbf (our radial basis function kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "These tuning parameters are often called **hyper-parameters**. These are parameters that affect the algorithm's \"learning\" process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4.1 The C parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another way to describe `C`. There are two types of SVM classifiers: hard margin and soft margin. Most SVM implementations are soft margin because \"soft\" allows for some points to be mis-classified when defining the margin (hard margin does not). The **C** parameter of the `svm.SVC` helps in choosing how \"soft\" to allow the margin to be:\n",
    "- small values of C allow for some point misclassification but lower the effect of noisy outliers\n",
    "- larger values of C push to accomodate even noisy points in favor of higher efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4.2 The $\\gamma$ parameter\n",
    "The $\\gamma$ value is part of the rbf (radial basis function). When thinking about the influence of $\\gamma$, it can be useful to think about it this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A small gamma value defines a Gaussian function with a large variance. In the case of a small gamma value, two points can be considered similar even if are far from each other.\n",
    "* On the other hand, a large gamma value defines a Gaussian function with a small variance and for this case, two points are considered similar just if they are close to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4.3 `GridSearchCV` and choosing hyper-parameters\n",
    "It can be difficult to search for an optimal combination of a set of hyper-parameters. What is the best combination of $C$ and $\\gamma$ for our digits data set? One way to avoid the issue is to test combinations of a fixed set of each hyper-parameter and evaluate which combinations are optimal. In this way we trade time (time to do all the testing) for better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below we use the import of <a href=\"https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html\"> `GridSearchCV` </a> from `sklearn.model.selection` (done in the cell at the top of the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind GridSearchCV is pretty simple:\n",
    "- provide a list of hyper-parameters and, for each hyper-parameter, a set of values you which to test.\n",
    "- `GridSearchCV` will **exhaustively** search, that is will try **all combinations** of the listed parameters, and based on the **best combination** will return results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above terms **exhautively** and **all combinations** are a kind of warning. These mean that considerable computational effort might be required to evaluate which hyper-parameter combinations is \"best\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**How many different $C$ and $\\gamma$ values does the code below explore?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How long will it take?\n",
    "You might need to be patient. On a decent desktop computer, 20-30 seconds, on a lightweight laptop, code might take more like a minute or two. It might take longer depending on what you are using!"
